/* irred.c	 					irred version forked from 3.15
 

***********************************************************
Forked version (2026):
    https://github.com/nclvrps/irred

Cleaned up with the assistance of Claude (chatbot)
to create a version suited for 64-bit machines
and modern optimizing compilers,
and to remove functionality now better performed by another program.

This forked version removes all sieving for polynomial factors,
and just does the irreducibility test.

As before, a 32-bit hexadecimal residue is printed
if a trinomial is not irreducible.

Sieving was removed because the GF2X package has the program "factor"
in the apps directory of its source code,
which is much better at finding polynomial factors.
(Not to be confused with the common GNU utility for factoring integers,
which is also called "factor")

For very large r where the "factor" program 
has not found any polynomial factor for a trinomial with some value of s
after searching candidate polynomials up to a very large degree d,
it will be faster to use this program to do an irreducibility test
rather than continuing to seek a factor.

Nonetheless, if this test does confirm non-reducibility, it is desirable
to take the time (eventually) to find a factor, for ease of verification.


For r equal to any Mersenne prime exponent other than 136279841,
all of the irreducible trinomials have already been found by Brent et al.
in 2016 and earlier.

For all non-irreducible trinomials (millions of them),
polynomials factors were found and recorded in certificate files.

Those certificate files are linked from:
https://maths-people.anu.edu.au/~brent/trinom.html

The check-ntl program is linked from the same page,
and it can be used to check non-irreducibility very quickly
by verifying the known factors listed in the certificate files.
 

Richard Brent's page about the original version of this program is at:
https://maths-people.anu.edu.au/~brent/irred.html
It is somewhat lacking in documentation.

The original version 3.15 of irred can be downloaded from:
https://maths-people.anu.edu.au/~brent/ftp/trinom/irred315.tar.gz


As of this writing (May 2026),
I don't know if anyone is searching for primitive trinomials
for r=136279841. Richard Brent's pages have not been updated
to reflect the discovery in 2024
of this latest and largest known Mersenne prime.

Author: Richard P. Brent (rpb@comlab.ox.ac.uk)

   	Samuli Larvala and Paul Zimmermann

Summary:

   An efficient test for irreducibility of trinomials
   x^r + x^s +1 (mod 2) where r is a prime, 
   or primitivity in the case that 2^r-1 is a Mersenne prime,
   using (32-bit or 64-bit) word-length bit operations.
   Written in C (with optional assembler routines for some machines).

Restrictions, Assumptions and Limitations:

   Assumes 0 < s < r, s >= LIM, r-s >= LIM,
   where LIM is usually twice the wordlength in bits,
   or six times the wordlength for ULTRA option,
   or ten times the wordlength for UNROLL option,
   or 256 for IBMPC ASM option
   (other cases can be handled by less efficient programs,
   e.g. irred version 1.35 or earlier versions,
     or irred version 1.50 with ODDS false).

   It is assumed that r is prime - if not true then a warning is printed.
   There is no check on whether or not 2^r-1 is prime.
   
   When output says A(x) is "irreducible" this actually means that
   x^(2^r) = x mod A(x). If r is not prime, we should also check
   that GCD(x^(2^d) - x, A(x)) = 1 for divisors d of r, but the program
   does not do this (it would be easy enough to add code to perform this
   check if desired).

   Similarly, if r is prime but 2^r-1 is not prime, then an
   irreducible A(x) might not be primitive, because x^((2^r-1)/p) mod A(x) 
   is not checked for any prime divisors p of 2^r-1. (In this case we
   can not complete the primitivity test without factoring 2^r-1.)

Usage:
   	  irred [-v] restart-file log-file time-limit skip-file
   	  					(all arguments optional)
Arguments:
          -v flag for VERBOSE output

          A restart file can be specified as first command line argument.
          If no file is specified, input data is read from stdin.

            Format of restart file or stdin is one line
              r s1 s2
            meaning to start next run at this (r,s1) and go to (r,s2-1)
            [or, if s1 > s2, go from (r,s1) to (r,s2+1)].
            If s1 = s2 then run is finished.

	  A log file can be specified as second command line argument.
	  If no file is specified, then log output -> stdout with an
	  identifier "LOG" (can be extracted using grep).

 	  Max minutes to run (m) can be specified as 3rd command line argument.
	
	    Maximum runtime is m minutes (infinite if m = 0).
	
	    The parameters m and s2 may be omitted (in which case they
	    assumed to be zero).
	
	  A skip file can be specified as the fourth command line argument.
	  This file is a list of pairs (u, v) (one per line) indicating that
	  s in the interval [u, v] should not be tested. This is useful if
	  certain intervals are already done or reserved for another machine.
	  If a skip file is desired, the parameter m must be specified
	  (possibly zero).
	  
	  For a "parallel" version using MPI, see irredpar.c

Comments on timing and memory requirements:

	Sieving quickly discards about 93% of polynomials.
	(NOTE: This forked version no longer does sieving.)
	Each polynomial not discarded by sieving takes time O(r^2)
	but there may be a slow-down as r increases (this is a cache effect).

	Space requirement is 7r/16 + (constant) bytes
	(temporarily increasing to 3r.FASTTRY/16 if FASTTRY > 2, see below).
	
	The working set after sieving is 3r/16 + (constant) bytes.

   it is not obvious why this works (perhaps due to real <-> virtual page
   mapping, perhaps due to conflict with system tables in L2 cache), but it
   does work on Portland/bsp0/tosca for r = 3021377. Seems to have little
   effect on booth (P-III running Solaris) or on non-IBM machines. 
   
   Also (for use in computing sieve cutoff) returns estimated overall time
