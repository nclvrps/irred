Summary:

   An efficient test for irreducibility of trinomials
   x^r + x^s +1 (mod 2) where r is a prime, 
   or primitivity in the case that 2^r-1 is a Mersenne prime,
   using (32-bit or 64-bit) word-length bit operations.
   Written in C (with optional assembler routines for some machines).

Restrictions, Assumptions and Limitations:

   Assumes 0 < s < r, s >= LIM, r-s >= LIM,
   where LIM is usually twice the wordlength in bits,
   or six times the wordlength for ULTRA option,
   or ten times the wordlength for UNROLL option,
   or 256 for IBMPC ASM option
   (other cases can be handled by less efficient programs,
   e.g. irred version 1.35 or earlier versions,
     or irred version 1.50 with ODDS FALSE).

   It is assumed that r is prime - if not true then a warning is printed.
   There is no check on whether or not 2^r-1 is prime.
   
   When output says A(x) is "irreducible" this actually means that
   x^(2^r) = x mod A(x). If r is not prime, we should also check
   that GCD(x^(2^d) - x, A(x)) = 1 for divisors d of r, but the program
   does not do this (it would be easy enough to add code to perform this
   check if desired).

   Similarly, if r is prime but 2^r-1 is not prime, then an
   irreducible A(x) might not be primitive, because x^((2^r-1)/p) mod A(x) 
   is not checked for any prime divisors p of 2^r-1. (In this case we
   can not complete the primitivity test without factoring 2^r-1.)

Usage:
   	  irred restart-file log-file time-limit skip-file
   	  					(all arguments optional)
Arguments:

          A restart file can be specified as first command line argument.
          If no file is specified, input data is read from stdin.

            Format of restart file or stdin is one line
              r s1 s2
            meaning to start next run at this (r,s1) and go to (r,s2-1)
            [or, if s1 > s2, go from (r,s1) to (r,s2+1)].
            If s1 = s2 then run is finished.

	  A log file can be specified as second command line argument.
	  If no file is specified, then log output -> stdout with an
	  identifier "LOG" (can be extracted using grep).

 	  Max minutes to run (m) can be specified as 3rd command line argument.
	
	    Maximum runtime is m minutes (infinite if m = 0).
	
	    The parameters m and s2 may be omitted (in which case they
	    assumed to be zero).
	
	  A skip file can be specified as the fourth command line argument.
	  This file is a list of pairs (u, v) (one per line) indicating that
	  s in the interval [u, v] should not be tested. This is useful if
	  certain intervals are already done or reserved for another machine.
	  If a skip file is desired, the parameter m must be specified
	  (possibly zero).
	  
	  A maximum number of interactive users can be specified as the
	  fifth command line argument to override the default MAXUSERS.

	  The sixth and seventh command-line arguments can be specified
	  to override the defaults LOADTOLR and LOADTOLS.

	  For a "parallel" version using MPI, see irredpar.c

Comments on timing and memory requirements:

	Sieving quickly discards about 93% of polynomials.
	Each polynomial not discarded by sieving takes time O(r^2)
	but there may be a slow-down as r increases (this is a cache effect).

	For a 300 MHz P-II with 512KB L2 cache, times range from
	1.07r^2 nsec (for r = 44497) to 1.72r^2 nsec (for r = 3021377).

	For a 500 MHz P-III with 512KB L2 cache, times range from
	0.67r^2 nsec (for r = 44497) to 0.80r^2 nsec (for r = 3021377).

	If we measure time in units of cycles, then the time on IBM PCs
	is about 0.33r^2 if the problem is small enough for the L1 cache,
	degrading to about 0.6r^2 if the L2 cache is half as large as
	necessary (e.g. 512KB for r = 6972593).

	Detailed timing results for different versions and (r,s)
	are in the separate file times.dat.

	Space requirement is 7r/16 + (constant) bytes
	(temporarily increasing to 3r.FASTTRY/16 if FASTTRY > 2, see below).
	
	The working set after sieving is 3r/16 + (constant) bytes.

Comments on different versions:

   Version 3.15 has
   
   1) Extra 4 words allocated before arrays p and q in main
      and a0 in main/fastmem to avoid (probably harmless) valgrind 
      diagnostics - thanks to Julian Seward and Andrew Tridgell for 
      pointing out the problem.

   Version 3.14 has
   
   1) UNROLL flag to permit 4-way unrolled version of reducer
      (good on Sparc Ultra-80).

   Version 3.13 has
   
   1) ULTRA flag to permit another version of reducer
      (good on Sparc Ultra-80 and MIPS R12000).

   Version 3.12 has
   
   1) Argument of prime(n) is type int instead of ULONG
      to avoid diagnostic on 64-bit (e.g. SGI) machines.

   Version 3.11 has
   
   1) Better documentation, no significant changes to the code.

   Version 3.10 has

   1) Explicit reference to the GNU General Public License (previously
      this information was communicated separately). 

   2) Test for primality of r (a warning is printed if r is composite).
      The irreducibility test assumes that r is prime, and is incomplete
      if r is composite (see comments above). Earlier versions assumed that
      r was prime without any check.

   Version 3.07 has
   
   1) More accurate output (only claims irreducible rather than primitive).
      The earlier versions assume r is a Mersenne exponent (so 2^r-1 prime),
      this version only assumes that r is prime and tests if the trinomial
      is irreducible. In general, if 2^r-1 is composite, further tests 
      depending on the factors of 2^r-1 are necessary to check primitivity.
      If 2^r-1 is prime, no further checks are necessary.
      
   Version 3.06 has
   
   1) Skip list handling fixed so can skip a single item 
   (previously low and high bounds equal terminated list processing).

   Versions 3.04 and 3.05 have

   1) New CPU info for booth (1-35, 51-55) and tosca.

   Version 3.03 has

   1) Option to modify load tolerances using command-line arguments.

   Version 3.02 has

   1) Improved version of sysload, no longer limited to range [0, 2.55].

   2) SLEEPTIME becomes two different constants SLEEPU, SLEEPL as the load
      is likely to change more often than the number of users.

   3) Option -2 for MAXUSERS (checks both userkt and sysload).

   Version 3.01 has

   1) More efficient versions of userkt and sysload, avoiding use
      of a temporary file.

   Version 3.00 has

   1) uptime instead of who|wc to count interactive users (this can
      give different results if one user has several sessions).

   2) Counters for clock and system calls.

   3) Better error handling for system calls (e.g. will not bomb if
      the file /tmp/irred.tmp is not writeable).

   4) Better error handling for command-line arguments, e.g.  skip file
      (so can use 0 or /dev/null if don't desire skip file (4th argument)
      but need 5th argument). All sscanf calls are now checked to see
      if the expected number of fields was found.

   5) Name changed: irredg -> irred (as it used to be).

   Version 2.93 has

   1) Flag BOOTH as shortcut for options on boothxx machines.

   2) option to sleep while load average is high (set MAXUSERS = -1).
      
   Versions 2.92 and 2.91 are experimental variants on the "sleeping" theme.   

   Version 2.90 has 
   
   1) option to go to sleep while the number of interactive users exceeds
      a tolerance (set MAXUSERS to a nonnegative value).

   Version 2.82 has
   
   1) Changed format of log file - hex numbers now have
      leading zeros instead of blanks. For example, 
      "x   12345" -> "x00012345".
      
      Old log files can be checked and converted to the
      format used by version 2.82 with the separate program "fixlog".

   Version 2.81 has
   
   1) Changed format of log file - if sodd = r-s > r/2 use
      r s yabcdefgh instead of r sodd xabcdefgh

   Version 2.80 has
   
   1) Dynamic choice of sieving cutoff, only use NEXTRA for upper bound.
      This should improve overall efficiency because the cutoff can 
      adapt to different machines/compilers and also to exceptional
      (r, s) values, e.g. if s is small or close to r/2.
   
   2) Printing of skip list commented out (as may be too long).

   Version 2.76 has

   1) Constant NEXTRA reduced from 4 to 3 in some cases, including
      (ASM AND IBMPC). This should save about 3% on average for time 
      per trinomial on IBM P-III such as booth, at the expense of a 
      small inconsistency in the log files produced on different machines.

   2) Introduction of LINUX flag to distinguish between Linux and Solaris
      (only use FASTTRY > 1 under Linux).

   Version 2.75 has

   1) Optional empirical choice of a "good" memory location for data arrays
      by timing of some dummy iterations. Perhaps surprisingly, this helps
      on Portland (P-II) when r is large. May depend on the operating system
      (seems less effective under Solaris than Linux).
      See FASTTRY and fastmem below.

   Version 2.72 has

   1) Memory allocation on stack instead of heap (this turned out to be
      no faster, so reverted to heap in later versions).

   Version 2.71 has
   
   1) Option CLEAR to clear space allocated by malloc before use
      (may also have effect of clearing L1 and L2 caches).

   2) Rounding up of size of data arrays to multiple of cache line
      size (32 bytes) for IBM PC (this did not help, so omitted in
      later versions).

   Version 2.70 has
   
   1) New MMX routine reducemx, similar to reducemr but making
      different alignment assumptions.
      
   2) Interface routine reduceml to call reducemr/reducemx as
      appropriate, ensuring the correct data alignment.
      
   3) prefetch instructions removed in reducer to speed small cases
      on P-II machines.  [Restored but commented out in version 2.76]

   Version 2.65 has

   1) MMX routine reducemr used instead of reducer in some case.

   Version 2.61 has
   
   1) Call to reducer if shift zero but (IBMPC AND ASM)
      (saves about 5% in the special case of shift zero,
       which should occur about 1 in 32 cases).

   Version 2.60 has 
   
   1) interlvr restored as versions without it were 
      sometimes slower than versions with it (at least this is
      true for r = 3021377 on booth, where 3r/16 bytes is very 
      close to the cache size - see comments re version 2.40 below).

   2) Space requirement decreased to 7r/16 bytes and
      working set after sieving decreased to 3r/16 bytes.

   Versions 2.51-2.54 have minor variations in interlvf MMX code.

   Version 2.50 has

   1) interlvr abolished, instead we use a cycle of length three
      involving interlvr to get better cache performance in reducer.

   2) Space requirement increased to r/2 bytes (formerly 7r/16 bytes),
      working set after sieving increased to r/4 bytes (formerly 3r/16 bytes).

      Version 2.50 seems about 10% slower than version 2.40 on booth, 
      for r = 3021377.  Slightly faster for r = 6972593 so may revert 
      to version 2.50 in the future.

   Version 2.40 has

   1) Call to MMX routine reducemr removed as non-MMX reducer is faster.
      [This may depend on data alignment. The problem is that we can't ensure 
       that data is aligned on 8-byte boundaries in calls to reducemr.]

   Version 2.34 has

   1) Improved reducer loop in irred.s (non-MMX code).

   2) Call to reducer instead of reducemr.

   Version 2.33 has

   1) Unrolled reducer restored from version 2.00 because faster
      on SPARC (no change in MMX version).

   Version 2.32 has

   1) Reordered loops in MMX code (version 2.31 is slightly different)

   Version 2.30 has

   1) Combined align and interleave, alternating forward and back.
      This gives improved performance on IBM PC, not much difference
      on other machines.

   2) Space requirement increased to 7r/16 bytes (formerly 3r/8 bytes)
      but working set after sieving is the same, 3r/16 bytes.

   3) Options FORWARD, MMX, TABLE, UNROLL eliminated as now redundant.

   Version 2.20 has
   
   1) FORWARD parameter for optional forward loop in alignmr[f] (MMX version)
      and aligner (C non-unrolled version).
      This improves cache performance in some cases.

   Version 2.12 has
   
   1) Faster (at least on Portland PC) interlvm with shorter inner loop
      (may be slower on booth)
	
   Version 2.11 has
   
   1) Replacement of some shifts and ors by adds in interlvm

   Version 2.10 has
   
   1) Option to use ASM without MMX, and new non-MMX IBM assembler
      routines interlv2, interlv3

   Version 2.01 has

   1) Improved comments.

   2) Improved loop control in reducemr, alignmr (now OK to call with
      kt negative).

   Version 2.00 has
   
   1) Improved algorithm with reduced memory references (C only so far).
      This algorithm is faster overall than the one used in earlier versions
      although sieving is slightly slower.
      
   2) Restriction that min(s, r-s) can not be too small (previously
      only r-s was restricted) and that r is odd. Use version 1.35 or 
      earlier if necessary to circumvent these restrictions.
      
   3) Because even s is replaced by r-s, log files produced by version 2.00
      are slightly different from those produced by version 1.35 and earlier.
      
   4) PRELOAD and TABLEZ flags abolished.   
   
   Version 1.50
     
   1) Optionally uses odd s (useful for checking version 2.00 and later),
      otherwise the same as version 1.35.

   Version 1.35 has
      
   1) Better detection of illegal parameters (if ASM AND IBMPC)
         
   Version 1.34 has
   
   1) More informative output re CPU type (if IBM PC).

   Version 1.33 has
   
   1) Faster code in case that r-s is divisible by 32 and IBM PC assembler
      is available (previously this case did not call assembler).

   2) ASM flag reinstated to replace MMX and MMX2 flags.

   Version 1.32 has
   
   1) More informative output - times for last sieve iteration
      and fraction of time spent sieving.

   2) Bug in versions 1.30 & 1.31 (which gave wrong "n" for log on stdout
      if printed in phase 2) fixed.
      
   3) Storage allocation bug (which caused segmentation fault if only one
      command-line argument on some machines) fixed.
        
   Version 1.31 has
   
   1) Unrolled option in reducer (may help on Sun etc).

   Version 1.30 has 
   
   1) Faster relprime calling reducer for inner loop
      (with assembler version for IBM PC).
   2) Introduction of NEXTRA and abolition of RATIO.
   3) Storage requirement reduced to 3r/8 + O(1) bytes.

   Version 1.25 has
   
   1) More CPU information in case of IBM PC.
   2) Two assembler versions - 
      one (irrednas.s) uses prefetching (works on PIII and above)
      the other (irredasm.s) without prefetching.
      (Note: later irredasm.s was abolished and irrednas.s renamed irred.s)

   Version 1.24 has
   
   1) MMX2 option to allow reduce2.s in case q1 and q1-q2 both odd.

   Version 1.23 has
   
   1) Alignment of most 8-byte accesses on 8-byte boundaries.
   2) Abolition of PORTLAND, ASM, OLDGCC, OLDR options.
   3) Merging of MMXR and MMXS options to MMX.

   Version 1.22 has
   
   1) Larvala's new MMX routines (renamed squarem and reducem)

   Version 1.21 has
   
   1) Alternative version of MMX (reduce2.s) modified RPB  

   Version 1.20 has

   1) MMXR and MMXS options for use of Multi Media extension (mmx) 
      instructions on Pentium etc (written by Samuli Larvala).

   Version 1.12 has
   
   1) Slightly faster reducea (though still some room for improvement ?)
      Set OLDR to use the old version of reducea (may be faster on machines
      other than IBM PC).
      
   2) Comments and output improved (2^p is never prime for p > 1 !).   

   Version 1.11 has
       
   1) ASM flag added and square.s implemented (IBM PC version only)
   2) comments improved 

   Compared to the previous versions 1.0 and earlier (unnumbered),
   version 1.1 has

   1) a fix to avoid timer overflow for large r.
   2) memory requirements for sieving reduced by about 46%.
   3) addition of a "skip file" as optional 4th command-line argument.
   4) various small enhancements and improvements in the comments.

Compilation flags:

   Set following flags to optimise performance depending on machine type
   and compiler.
   
   On an IBM PC which can execute MMX instructions it is best 
   to set ASM = TRUE and use the assembler routines in irred.s
   (version 3.10 or higher).
